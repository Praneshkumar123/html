             You'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions.

             One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.

             With new technologies coming out often in such a fast paced and ever-changing industry, it can quickly get confusing for beginner coders.

             When learning how to code, instead of just focusing on learning a specific technology, it can also help to learn the foundations – the building blocks – and to peel back the layers of abstraction to get to know the underlying principles that all these technologies have in common.

             Understanding what coding is at a fundamental level will make solving problems easier and will give you a better understanding of how these technologies work underneath the hood.

              In this article we will learn what coding is so you have a solid foundation on which to build.
